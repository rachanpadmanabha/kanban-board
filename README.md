## Introduction

This project is a React-based Kanban board application that allows users to manage tasks across different stages of completion. It features a drag-and-drop interface for easy task management and organization.

## Features

- Interactive Kanban board with multiple columns
- Drag-and-drop functionality for moving tasks between columns
- Drag-and-drop for reordering tasks within columns
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Keyboard accessibility for drag-and-drop operations

## Technologies Used

- React
- [dnd-kit](https://dndkit.com/) for drag-and-drop functionality
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Component Breakdown

### KanbanBoard.js

- Main component that manages the overall state and logic of the Kanban board
- Handles drag-and-drop operations between columns

### CardColumns.js

- Renders individual columns of the Kanban board
- Manages the sortable context for cards within a column

### Card.js

- Represents individual task cards
- Implements drag-and-drop functionality for each card

### Draggable.js

- A reusable component that makes its children draggable

### Droppable.js

- A reusable component that creates a droppable area

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-kanban-board.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd react-kanban-board
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Usage

- Drag and drop cards between columns to change their status.
- Reorder cards within a column by dragging them up or down.
- Use keyboard navigation (Tab and arrow keys) and spacebar/enter to move cards for accessibility.

## Customization

### Adding New Columns

To add new columns, modify the `columnData` in `data.js`:

```javascript
export const columnData = [
  { id: 'todo', name: 'To Do', data: [...] },
  { id: 'in-progress', name: 'In Progress', data: [...] },
  { id: 'done', name: 'Done', data: [...] },
  // Add new columns here
];
```

### Styling

The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. Modify the classes in the component files to change the appearance of the Kanban board and cards.

## Performance Considerations

- The `Card` component uses `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Consider implementing virtualization for boards with a large number of cards.
